A complex timetable building program based on an evolutionary algorithm, with web and desktop UIâ€™s.

The logical engine is an independent thread-safe module with a lot of configuration preferences,
to control the evolutionary algorithm and run it in the most efficient way.
The engine has the ability to extract the initial data and settings from an XML file.

The JavaFX desktop application is a multi-threaded well designed program with three different themes.
It enables the user to set and run the algorithm, see its progress and watch the results.

The web application added the options to sign in and register to the site, upload multiple XML files,
solve other users timetables and watch their results.
